        No PDB constructs with detected expression tag. Top constructs probably have incorrectly annotated SEQRES records, containing only the observed residues.

                Probably authentic construct sequence, and has N-terminal TEV cleavage site. But this is isoform beta-1 (P45983-3). The Harvard plasmid is isoform alpha-1 (P45983-1), and the UniProt canonical isoform is alpha-2 (P45983-2). The latter two isoforms are identical except for a region at the C-terminus, outside the catalytic domain. Downweighting this construct results in 2NO3_A becoming the top-ranked sequence.

        comment: >
            Paper doesn't appear to mention sequence, but the PDB SEQRES records are identical to a number of other PDB entries, including 3O2M, from which the construct sequence can be confirmed as correct. Note that the PDB construct includes mutations T183E and Y185E.

                Sequence and E coli expression confirmed from paper. However, the PDB chains include two regions of the protein which were actually expressed as separate proteins. The algorithm here would select the region span comprising the two regions plus the region inbetween. 4LG4 by the same authors is a much more suitable construct, consisting of only the kinase catalytic domain. It was expressed with a TEV cleavage site, but only a single non-WT Gly is left behind, and this is not detected automatically by the construct authenticity algorithm.

            See notes for 4LGD. Regarding the aligment_override, ClustalO provides a non-ideal alignment which needs to be overridden.
