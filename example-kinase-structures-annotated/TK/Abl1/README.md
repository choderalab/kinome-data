* 2HYY - human abl1 kinase domain; imatinib
* 1OPL - SH3, SH2 and kinase domains; no nucleotide; SH2 bound to kinase C-lobe; includes kinase C-term helix up to 511 (turns, then helix)
* 2F4J - kinase domain with C-term up to 513 (straight helix)
* 2FO0 - SH3, SH2 and kinase domains; SH2 bound to kinase C-lobe; includes C-term up to 511 (turns, then helix); PD166326 inhibitor  at ATP-site; Myr bound at C-term site
* 3K5V - mouse kinase domain with C-term up to 510 (turns, then helix); imatinib plus allosteric inhibitor GNF-2; inactive conformation
* 2Z60 - mouse kinase domain with C-term up to 511 (continued helix with slight bend); T315I mutant; PPY-A inhibitor; active conformation (idea is that the helix disrupts the interactions between SH2 and the kinase domain
