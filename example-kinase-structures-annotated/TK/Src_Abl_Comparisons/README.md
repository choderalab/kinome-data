# Src and Abl PDB notes. 

These structures are all in their relevant Src or Abl directory, but it is also useful to compare them here...

* (i) or (o) refer to supposed DFG-in or DFG-out conformations, respectively. (Not neccessarily complete.)
* (IMA) or (BOS) refer to Imatinib or Bosutinib bound conformations, respectively. (Not neccessarily complete.)
* (inact) or (act) refer to inactive or active conformations.(Not neccessarily complete.)
* Numbers refer to the paper they were referenced in: 1-5 are simulation papers, 6-10 are structure papers from either Seeliger or Levinson.

**NOTE** These annotations are far from complete, but a guideline for now regarding the important characteristics of each structure.
