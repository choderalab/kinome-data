Example kinase structures with various types of useful annotation, such as
domain spans (e.g. kinase catalytic domain, SH2 domain) named structural
elements (e.g. "C-helix", "A-loop"), functional information from literature
(e.g. whether a structure is thought to represent an active state,
autoinhibited state etc.).

Of particular interest
----------------------

* AGC/PKA\_C-alpha - 1ATP, annotated and colored according to Endicott Johnson Annu Rev Biochem 2012 ("The structure basis for control of eukaryotic protein kinases")
* TK/abl/2fO0 - Abl1 isoform IB; SH3, SH2, kinase domain; autoinhibited state; N-terminal myristoyl bound in kinase domain; kinked C-term helix
* TK/src/1fmk - SH3, SH2, kinase domain; autoinhibited state
* AGC/PKB/3cqw - AGC C-term domain, substrate peptide bound
* TK/insR/1ir3 - substrate peptide bound

Notes
-----

* PI3K-PI4K refers to kinases from the PI3/PI4-kinase family, such as MTOR.
