  <h4>Background:</h4>
    The aim is to select a panel of kinases suitable for <i>E. coli</i> expression in 96-well plates.
    <br/>
    Ideally, the kinase catalytic domain is to be expressed in isolation.
    <br/>
    Plasmids are provided from two libraries: SGC Oxford and Harvard HIP pJP1520.
    <br/>
    The PDB is used here as a source of constructs which have been successfully expressed. For each kinase target, the PDB is searched for matching constructs from any species, expressed in <i>E. coli</i>.
  <h4>Custom selection procedure:</h4>
  <ul class="list-group">
    <li>All kinase domain targets with a matching SGC Oxford plasmid suitable for <i>E. coli</i> expression.</li>
    <li>Plus all other kinase domain targets which have a matching HIP pJP1520 plasmid, as well as at least one matching PDB construct from any species, expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, and with an authenticity score of &gt; 0.</li>
    <li>The authenticity score is an attempt to circumvent problems assocaited with the frequent misannotation of sequences in PDB entries (the SEQRES records often contain only the structurally resolved sequence instead of the actual sequence used in the experiment). The score is generated by searching for expression tags within a PDB construct&mdash;anything with a detected expression tag is given a positive authenticity score. The assumption here is that expression tags are generally not resolved, and thus SEQRES records containing expression tags are less likely to have been erroneously annotated with only the observed sequence.</li>
    <li>If multiple suitable constructs are available for a kinase domain target, the construct with the lowest number of extraneous residues outside the catalytic domain region will be selected for expression testing.</li>
    <li>Selected PDB construct sequences will be mapped onto matching plasmid sequences and subcloned.</li>
  </ul>
