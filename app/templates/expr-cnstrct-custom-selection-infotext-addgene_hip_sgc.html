  <h4>Background:</h4>
    The aim is to select a panel of kinases suitable for <i>E. coli</i> expression in 96-well plates.
    <br/>
    Ideally, the kinase catalytic domain is to be expressed in isolation.
    <br/>
    Plasmids are provided from three libraries: addgene Human Kinase ORF collection, Harvard HIP pJP1520, and SGC Oxford.
    <br/>
    Construct spans are provided from PDB entries with <i>E. coli</i> expression system annotations, and from the SGC Oxford plasmid library (only plasmids known to express well in <i>E. coli</i>).
  <h4>Custom selection procedure:</h4>
  <ul class="list-group">
    <li>A kinase domain target is added to the table below if it has both a suitable expression construct sequence and a matching plasmid (from any of the SGC, HIP or addgene libraries).</li>
    <li>A suitable expression construct sequence is either a) a PDB construct expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and with an authenticity score of &gt; 0, or b) an SGC Oxford plasmid.</li>
    <li>The authenticity score is an attempt to circumvent problems assocaited with the frequent misannotation of sequences in PDB entries (the SEQRES records often contain only the structurally resolved sequence instead of the actual sequence used in the experiment). The score is generated by searching for expression tags within a PDB construct&mdash;anything with a detected expression tag is given a positive authenticity score. The assumption here is that expression tags are generally not resolved, and thus SEQRES records containing expression tags are less likely to have been erroneously annotated with only the observed sequence.</li>
    <li>If multiple suitable constructs are available for a kinase domain target, the construct with the lowest number of extraneous residues outside the catalytic domain region will be selected for expression testing.</li>
    <li>PDB construct sequences, if selected, will be mapped onto matching plasmid sequences and subcloned.</li>
  </ul>
