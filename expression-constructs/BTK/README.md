BTK construct, chosen from PDB data, and sent to DNA 2.0 for synthesis of optimized DNA sequence, cloning into plasmid vector, and bacterial expression testing.

The amino acid sequence contains a C-terminal TEV cleavage site, followed by a short linker.
The plasmid (pD444-CH) contains a 6His-tag, C-terminal of the insert.
